# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis (EDA)  

📊 **Understanding the impact of demographics on students' test scores**  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores how **students' performance** (test scores) is influenced by various factors such as **gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation courses**.  

We perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights and trends in the dataset.  

## 📂 Dataset Details  
- **📥 Source:** [Kaggle - Student Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977)  
- **📊 Features:**  
  - **Mathematics, Reading, and Writing Scores**  
  - **Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Education**  
  - **Lunch Type & Test Preparation Course**

## 🔍 Key Insights  
✔️ Most students score between **60-80** in **Mathematics**, while in **Reading and Writing**, most scores range between **50-80**.  
✔️ The **gender ratio** is nearly balanced: **48% female** and **52% male**.  
✔️ **Ethnicity Group C** has the highest number of students.  
✔️ **More students have standard lunch** than free/reduced lunch.
